## Overview

I built and scaled two AI‑driven video channels—TikTok and YouTube—by automating content ideation, media creation, and publishing workflows. Leveraging Midjourney for character‑based imagery, LumaLabs for video generation, and on‑trend sounds/music, the channels quickly grew to over 670,000 TikTok followers and more than 250,000 YouTube views.

## Key Features

- **AI Script & Storyboard Generation**: GPT‑4 drafts engaging scripts and visual shot lists tailored to trending topics and SEO insights.
- **Midjourney Imagery**: Generated stylized character assets in Midjourney, then integrated them into video scenes for brand consistency.
- **LumaLabs Video Assembly**: Automated video creation with LumaLabs pipelines, combining AI narration, Midjourney visuals, and dynamic captions.
- **Scalable Design System**: Programmatically sourced and overlaid popular sounds/music from sound libraries and TikTok’s trending feed.
- **Cross‑Platform Publishing**: Used TikTok & YouTube Data APIs to schedule uploads, optimize metadata, and A/B test titles and thumbnails.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI GPT‑4**: Script and storyboard creation.
- **Midjourney**: Character‑driven image generation.
- **LumaLabs**: Automated video rendering and compilation.
- **TikTok & YouTube Data APIs**: Programmatic uploads and analytics.
- **TikTok & YouTube Data APIs**: Programmatic uploads and analytics.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
