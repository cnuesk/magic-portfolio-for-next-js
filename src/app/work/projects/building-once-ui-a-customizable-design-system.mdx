## Overview

Built a streamlined system that scrapes market‑relevant Reddit threads in real time, ingests live news feeds via APIs, and drives AI‑powered day‑trading decisions.

## Key Features

- **Reddit Bot Scraping**: Python bots (PRAW) monitor target subreddits for posts/comments, handling rate limits and proxies.
- **Real‑Time News Integration**: Aggregates headlines and articles from NewsAPI, Benzinga, and Yahoo Finance APIs to complement sentiment signals.
- **AI Trading Signals 1**: NLP pipeline (spaCy, NLTK) generates sentiment scores.
- **AI Trading Signals 2**: Lightweight ML models (LSTM, random forest) combine sentiment + news indicators to predict intraday price moves.
- **Automated Execution**: Alpaca API connectivity for order placement with built‑in risk controls and dynamic stop‑loss logic.

## Technologies Used

- **PY**: Python (PRAW, spaCy, TensorFlow), NewsAPI/Benzinga, Alpaca API, React dashboard.

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing noisy text and slang from Reddit—expanded lexicons and custom tokenizers improved accuracy.

## Outcome

Balancing low‑latency trading with robust model inference—batched API calls and model quantization were key.
